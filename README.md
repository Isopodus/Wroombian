# Wroombian

<strong>Operating system for ESP32</strong>

*Made just for fun, but can be extended to something more useful.*

Wroombian is an attempt to create a working operating system for the ESP32 microcontroller. It is based on slightly modified <a href="https://micropython.org/">Micropython</a> and <a href="https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo">LoBo Micropython</a> firmwares and allows you to create different sorts of projects for various purposes.

Please head to the [wiki page](https://github.com/Isopodus/Wroombian/wiki) to read about features and get some usage instructions.

## Limitations: 
This is a work in progress version of an OS. If you have any offers or found a bug, feel free to ask in the <a href="https://github.com/Isopodus/Wroombian/issues">Issues</a> section.
