# Wroombian

<strong>Operating system for ESP32</strong>

*Made just for fun, but can be extended to something more useful.*

Wroombian is an attempt to create a working operating system for the ESP32 microcontroller. It is based on slightly modified Micropython and LoBo Micropython firmwares and allows you to create different sorts of projects for various purposes.

Please head to the [wiki page](https://github.com/Isopodus/Wroombian/wiki) to read about features and get some usage instructions.

## Limitations: 
This is a work in progress version of an OS. If you have any offers or found a bug, feel free to ask in the <a href="https://github.com/Isopodus/Wroombian/issues">Issues</a> section.
